                <p>Greetings and Salutations from my friend Mr.S. I wish I could say if you hired me he would be a
                    welcome addition into such a pup friendly office, but he’s sadly moved out of NYC so that would be a
                    promise
                    I could not keep. He’s also ungodly loud at all hours of the day, so he’d probably be more of a
                    hindrance
                    than a help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways, if you’ve made it to this link you must have found my answers to your first two questions
                    absolutely riveting. Or it’s Friday and you’re bored, I’ll take either.
                </p>

                    I put together this small website to give you a quick rundown on me, michelle. I worked in
                    advertising for
                    seven years, four of which were at a small and very creative media company that hand painted murals
                    — I
                    loved every aspect of working there but realized after a while I was lost in what I wanted to do in
                    life. I
                    packed up my things and headed to Hawaii to learn how to code (absolutely brilliant location to take
                    a break
                    from NYC and learn a new skill). Since returning to la gran manzana and trying to break into tech
                    I’ve
                    continued on this little journey of life, working on projects and volunteering with organizations
                    that fuel
                    my passions. Throw in a couple life “milestones” and a pandemic you find me here, applying to
                    work for
                    ya’ll and spinning up a website for a part time role that may very well be filled.

                    While sitting in the dentist chair the other day and wondering if such a place destroys all
                    egos
                    like it does mine, I took another ponder at life. I realized what I missed most was working in a
                    fast paced, small agency that produced amazing
                    creative
                    content. Though I couldn’t draw a stick figure if you paid me, and to this day I do not understand
                    the differences in typefaces, I know where I thrive: and that’s working somewhere that I can wear
                    many hats and handle
                    multiple responsibilities while getting a taste of what’s happening. While I continue to hone my
                    tech
                    skills and
                    promise to pet and love every dog equally at your company, I’d love the chance to make ya’lls office
                    run
                    smoother and be that cheerful face that will tell you a truly awful day-of-the-week joke when you
                    need a
                    laugh.
                </p>

                    Until then, thanks for reading this novel and you can find me <a
                        href="mailto:moyer.mj@gmail.com">here</a> or staring at strangers in Washington Square Park.
